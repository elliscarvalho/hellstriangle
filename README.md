# hellstriangle

This project solves the hells triangle problem.
It was developed with C# and .NET framework, mainly because it is the language I use every day at work and I'm used to its syntax.
The unit tests were developed using Microsoft unit test framework and a name pattern (Action_InputContext_ExpectedOutput) was used to facilitate the understanding of the test scenarios.

To open the solution, use the Microsoft Visual Studio tool.
To run the console app, execute the file "HellsTriangle.exe".
